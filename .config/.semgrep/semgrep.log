-----
Command failed with output:
fatal: No remote configured to list refs from.


Failed to run 'git ls-remote --get-url'. Possible reasons:

- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the baseline commit is not a parent of the current commit
    (if you are running through semgrep-app, check if you are setting `SEMGREP_BRANCH` or `SEMGREP_BASELINE_COMMIT` properly)
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
